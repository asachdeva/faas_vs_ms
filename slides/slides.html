# What is Serverless Computing (FaaS)?
The phrase “serverless” doesn’t mean servers are no longer involved. It simply means that developers no longer have to think that much about them. -- Ken Fromm
*Building and Running Applications that do not require server management, and instead run on ephemeral containers *<br>
<br>
* **Deployment Model**
 * Applications that are bundled as one or more functions are uploaded to a platform
 * Functions are executed and billed in response to the exact demand needed at the moment
* **Server Architecture**
  * No need for 'always' on server system
  * The PaaS starts the instances in 20ms and run for short bursts to satisfy requests and then perish  
  
---

# Serverless Impacts 

  * Application Impact 
   * Architecture design needs to designed to be ephemeral
      * stateless services, distributed caches
      * no long running services
   * Application code needs to emulate the platform as a service pattern
 
  * Operations Impact: Infra Abstraction 
   * Elastic --> Autoscale and No host config
   * On demand --> Boot in 20ms
   * Pay as you go --> fine grained pay-per-use on cloud as in per-call costs
   * Automatic spin down   
      
  **These are typically always cloud managed services aka NoOps**
   * What Faas gives you?
   * Pure functions triggered on demand
   * Dynamic scalability -- more calls, more instances   
   * Behavior is explicit and expected
   * Refactoring is less painful
   * IaaC abilities -- no more per app infra architectures

# Pure Function
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/UHZmjKl.png" width="800">

---
      
# Faas Framework 
* All major cloud providers have products
  * AWS, GCP, Azure, OVH   

* Alternatively you can deploy your own Faas framework
  * OpenWhisk, OpenFaaS, OracleFN, Gestalt, Nuclio
      
* You can leverage on existing CaaS and out value on top of it
  * Container encapsulation of the function, k8s orchestration

# Serverless Key Aspects from a Dev/App Perspective
Devs gain a greater produtivity by focusing on business valuable code.
Devs get to design applications with pure functions in mind      

1. **Serverless is an architecture trend**<br>
   
2. **A Serverless application is a mashup of value-added managed services**<br>
   
3. **Fits modern arhcitecture stakes**<br>
Cloud Native applications, 12 factors...

# Serverless Key Aspects from an Ops Perspective
Ops gets more efficiency
Ops gets to offload serveral concerns to platform      

1. **Autoscale and resilient by design**<br>
   
2. **Almost NoOps**<br>
   
3. **Fits Cloud Promise**<br>
On Demand, Elastic, Pay-per-use

# MicroService Architecture
Microservice architecture is a set of self-sustained small services, 
running on their own machines using lightweight mechanisms (usually REST APIs’) 
to allow inter-module communication of the underlying application.      

---

# Compare and Contrast
Pricing is the first differentiator. 
Serverless is pay-as-you-go, making it an attractive option for applications with infrequent requests. 
It also reduces operational costs as infrastructure and virtual machines are handled by a service provider
rather than directly on-premise, IaaS or PaaS.

Scalability is also outstanding on serverless architecture – 
by its nature it can handle spike loads more easily and can be automatically managed quickly and transparently.
The only caveat is the maximum number of requests that can be processed making it unsuitable for high load systems.      

---

# Compare and Contrast (cont)
Serverless is more granular than microservices, and provides a much higher degree of functionality. 
On the flip-side, that also creates much more complexity. It also has a number of other restrictions, 
such as a limited number of requests and operation duration, and supports fewer programming languages.

The level of granularity you get with serverless can also affect tooling and frameworks. 
This is because the higher the granularity, the more complicated integration testing becomes, 
making it more difficult to debug, troubleshoot and test.

---

# Summary
Although microservices still provides a solid approach to service oriented architecture (SOA), 
serverless is gaining ground in event-based architecture and clearly has advantages in terms of 
reduced time to market, flexible pricing and reduced operational costs.

It’s unlikely for now that serverless will or should be the approach for every system – 
but watch this space as it matures. For now the best solution is a combination of both 
architectural approaches to help deliver and take advantage of the benefits the cloud brings to you and your customers.
